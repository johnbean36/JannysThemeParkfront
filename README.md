### **Description**
Welcome to Janny's World! Here at Janny's World we are using a MERN stack to sell you tickets to our awesome theme park! Simply browse to our 'Buy tickets' page, fill out your info, and hit submit. React handles this, and uses a Axios call to save your data to a Mongoose Database.
